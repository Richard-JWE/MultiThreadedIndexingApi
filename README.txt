This application was designed and developed to use a multithreaded indexing API. The application uses Java 19.   
A word index can be created from an e-book(.txt) file provided with the project. The index outputs a list
of words that relate to the page numbers on which they appear and the dictionary defined meaning of each word. The dictionary is provided in the 
application. Users can load e-book(.txt), build a user made index of words.The application can associate words with 
definitions and page numbers. The build time and unique words are noted 
The menu choice can be picked using an numerical value[1-6]. Words from the google-100.txt are excluded from being indexed.
